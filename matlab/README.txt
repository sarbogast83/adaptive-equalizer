		Input:
			No direct imputs are needed in this script. 
			*** Ensure floating_point_ref.mat is locally available to this script to be read in in the init section. ***

	SystemC
		The SystemC floating point model realizes the adaptive filter at the RTL level using floating point values. It is expected that a correctly implemented model should mirror the MATLAB floating point model neglible errror. 
		
		Inputs:
			The SystemC model requires two txt files, the trainign sequence 'd' and corrupted sequence 'u'. The txt fiels are written in colume form with the first value of the file listing the total number of samples. 
			- dn.txt
			- un.txt
			
		Output: 
			The model writes three data sets to txt, the 'd hat' vector, 'e' vector, and final set of 'W' coeffiecents, sample 1012. 
			- dhatn.txt
			- en.txt
			- w.txt

			Print to terminal:
				The executable prints the length of dn and un ensuring correct read ins
				The model prints the first 'clock' period outputs
					[ "dn: " << dn << "\tun: " << un << "\tdhat:" << dhatOut << "\ten: " << enOut ]
				
		Build:
			The model build requires the instalation of the SystemC library. The supplied Makefile are set to build in a Linux enviroment using gcc. Update as needed for enviroment and correct path to the SystemC library.
